# Baconator

The Baconator is a Rails app that covers three basic things:

  1. Parsing a set of JSON files that contain films and actors into a
     relational DB
  2. Scanning that database and building shortest path relationship from
     every actor to Kevin Bacon
  3. Allowing a user to query by actor name and see their Bacon Path
